      <description>The long-term goal of EffL is to make AI more responsible&amp;ndash;accessible, sustainable, and righteous.&#xA;As the first step, we are focusing on various facets of Efficient ML, which could help us make AI equally accessible to anybody on Earth, with no extreme carbon emission.&#xA;In particular, we work on three dimensions:&#xA;Inference. We develop fast, low-resource methods to serve massive multimodal AI, e.g., Model Compression Parallel Decoding Batch Scheduling Training. We resolve the compute / memory bottlenecks for training large-scale models, e.</description>

      <description>We mainly target top-tier ML conferences, e.g., NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR.&#xA;Sometimes, we also submit to domain-specific venues that involve ML, e.g., Vision/Language/Speech.&#xA;Note: Some papers below does not involve the PI.&#xA;2024 # In Search of a Data Transformation that Accelerates Neural Field Training&#xA;Junwon Seo, Sangyoon Lee, Kwang In Kim, and Jaeho Lee&#xA;CVPR 2024 Oral (top 90 of 11,532 submissions) (NeurIPS 2023 Workshop: Attributing Model Behavior at Scale)</description>
