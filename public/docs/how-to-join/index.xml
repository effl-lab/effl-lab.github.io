Transcript (with rank) CV/R√©sum√© A short statement of your research interests We will have a short coffee chat to discuss the next steps.
Advising Statement # As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:
keep the group handleable-sized, have individual weekly meetings (30&amp;ndash;60mins at least), be maximally supportive to your career decisions, and keep non-academic burdens minimal. I expect EffLers to
patiently lead their own research agenda, maintain the highest level of academic honesty and intellectual humility, gain top-notch expertise in their own area, and willingly share their knowledge with fellow EffLers.</description>
