We develop fast, low-resource methods to serve massive multimodal AI. Area: Model Compression, Advanced Decoding, Batch Scheduling Training. We resolve the compute and memory bottlenecks for training large-scale models. Area: Meta-Learning, Model Merging, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Data Dimension. We design principled algorithms to handle data with extremely high dimensionality (e.g., video, astronomy). Area: Data Compression, High-res Video Processing, Time-Series Forecasting For more, see our papers.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/research/papers/","title":"Papers","section":"Research","content":" 2023 # Learning Large-scale Neural Fields via Context Pruned Meta-learning\nJihoon Tack, Subin Kim, Sihyun Yu, Jaeho Lee, Jinwoo Shin, and Jonathan R.
