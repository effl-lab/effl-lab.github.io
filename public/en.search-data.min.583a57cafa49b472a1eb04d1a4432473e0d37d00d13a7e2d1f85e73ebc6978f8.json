We develop fast, low-resource methods to serve massive multimodal AI. Area: Model Compression, Advanced Decoding, Batch Scheduling Training. We resolve the compute and memory bottlenecks for training large-scale models. Area: Meta-Learning, Model Merging, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Data Dimension. We design principled algorithms to handle data with extremely high dimensionality (e.g., video, astronomy). Area: Data Compression, High-res Video Processing, Time-Series Forecasting For more, see our papers.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/how-to-join/graduate/","title":"M.S./Ph.D. üéì","section":"How to Join?","content":"We have 2\u0026ndash;3 openings, through POSTECH EE and Graduate School of AI.\n(as of October 2023)\nPlease email Jaeho with your\nTranscript (with rank) CV/R√©sum√© A short statement of your research interests We will have a short coffee chat to discuss the next steps.\nAdvising Statement # As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:\nkeeping the group handleable-sized, having individual weekly meetings (30\u0026ndash;60mins at least), and keeping non-academic burdens minimal.

You know very little about ML/DL. Goal: Complete an online DL coursework (e.g., this, this or this). L2. You are familiar with DL, but not research. Goal: Select a research topic and learn how to read papers. L3. You can read papers, and code in PyTorch/Jax. Goal: Read papers up to the research frontier, and start doing research. (2) Weekly Meeting # You will have a weekly meeting with Jaeho and other interns.\nIn every other meeting (i.e., twice a month), you are expected to do the following:\nL1. Cover a deep learning video lecture; provide your own version of summary. L2. Summarize a research paper, that is aligned with your interest. L3. Present your research progress. (3) Promotion # If you are L1 or L2, and feel you\u0026rsquo;re ready to get promoted, apply for a defense.\nIn the very next meeting, we will test if you have what it takes to become the next level.\n(4) Small Perks # Your own desk, located in the graduate student office. Free use of capsule coffee machines, printers, and Wi-Fi. Non-mandatory invitations to group lunches and dinners.
