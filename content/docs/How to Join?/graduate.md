Here are some notes by Jaeho.


### **Advising Statement**

As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:
- keep the group handleable-sized,
- have individual weekly meetings (30--60mins at least),
- be maximally supportive to the career decisions of the students,
- and keep non-academic burdens minimal.

I expect EffLers to
- patiently lead their own research agenda,
- maintain the highest level of academic honesty and intellectual humility,
- gain top-notch expertise in their own area,
- and willingly share their knowledge with fellow EffLers.



### **Resources & Financial Support**

We provide the followings for any M.S. or Ph.D. candidates.

- A competitive monthly stipend.
	- This, of course, comes with research duties on the funded projects.
- A laptop/desktop computer, among some options.
	- I strongly recommend getting a Linux/Mac.
	- Any purchased computer is technically a university property; use for research only.
- Minimum 4 GPUs + Cluster access per person for research uses.
	- We have a mixture of RTX 6000 Ada / RTX 4090 / A6000 / A5000.
	- More GPUs on Clouds will be available, if needed.
- Travel fund, if you have a first-authored paper accepted to target ML conferences.

Exclusive for Ph.D. candidates:

- Additional support for computers & monitors.
- One-time travel grant for an ML conference, even without a paper accepted.
