### **Advising Statement**

As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:
- keeping the group handleable-sized,
- having individual weekly meetings (30--60mins at least),
- and keeping non-academic burdens minimal.

I expect EffLers to
- patiently lead their own research agenda,
- gain top-notch expertise in their own area,
- and willingly share their knowledge with fellow EffLers.
