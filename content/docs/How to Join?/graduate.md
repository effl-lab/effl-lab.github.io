### **Advising Statement**

As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:
- keep the group handleable-sized,
- have individual weekly meetings (30--60mins at least),
- be maximally supportive to your career decisions,
- and keep non-academic burdens minimal.

I expect EffLers to
- patiently lead their own research agenda,
- maintain the highest level of academic honesty and intellectual humility,
- gain top-notch expertise in their own area,
- and willingly share their knowledge with fellow EffLers.
