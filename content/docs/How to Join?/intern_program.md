### **Internship Program**
We treat interns differently with respect to your skill levels.

#### (1) Level System
We'll put you into one of three groups: **L1, L2, L3**, depending on your level of expertise.  

- **L1.** You know very little about ML/DL.
	- Goal: Complete an online DL coursework (e.g., [this](http://introtodeeplearning.com), [this](http://cs231n.stanford.edu) or [this](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2023-fall-65940)).
- **L2.** You are familiar with DL, but not research.
	- Goal: Select a research topic and learn how to read papers.
- **L3.** You can read papers, and code in PyTorch/Jax.
	- Goal: Read papers up to the research frontier, and start doing research.

#### (2) Weekly Meeting
You will have a **weekly meeting** with Jaeho and other interns.

In every other meeting (i.e., twice a month), you are expected to do the following:
- **L1.** Cover a deep learning video lecture; provide your own version of summary.
- **L2.** Summarize a research paper, that is aligned with your interest.
- **L3.** Present your research progress.

#### (3) Promotion
If you are L1 or L2, and feel you're ready to get promoted, apply for a _defense._  
In the very next meeting, we will test if you have what it takes to become the next level.


#### (4) Small Perks
- Your own desk, located in the graduate student office.  
- Free use of capsule coffee machines, printers, and Wi-Fi.  
- Non-mandatory invitations to group lunches and dinners.
