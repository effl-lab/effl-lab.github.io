The long-term goal of EffL is to make AI more *responsible*--accessible, sustainable, and righteous.

As the first step, we are focusing on various facets of **Efficient ML**, which could help us make AI equally accessible to anybody on Earth, with no extreme carbon emission.

In particular, we work on three dimensions:
- **Inference.** We develop fast, low-resource methods to serve massive multimodal AI.  
	- _Area:_ Model Compression, Advanced Decoding, Batch Scheduling
- **Training.** We resolve the compute and memory bottlenecks for training large-scale models.  
	- _Area:_ Meta-Learning, Model Merging, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
- **Data Dimension.** We design principled algorithms to handle data with extremely high dimensionality (e.g., video, astronomy).
	- _Area:_ Data Compression, High-res Video Processing, Time-Series Forecasting
